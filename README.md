# Nightpad
A Windows Notepad-clone with a dark theme using Python and PySimpleGUI.


This is my attempt at making a Notepad-clone with a dark theme using Python and PySimpleGUI.
References I've used: "Notepad In Python | PySimpleGUI" guide by Izzy Analytics and the PySimpleGUI Cookbook.
I have added character- and word-counters that use lists to determine the correct numbers.
I am Currently in the process of figuring out how to correctly open files with unicode-characters.
